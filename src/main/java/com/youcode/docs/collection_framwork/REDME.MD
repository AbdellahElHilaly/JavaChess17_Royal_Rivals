# Collection Framework
## Definition 
- A collection is an object that represents a group of objects of similar types, exist in java.util package.

## Iterable Interface
- Iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes. The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface and therefore all the subclasses of Collection interface also implement the Iterable interface. It contains only one abstract method. i.e., iterator(). So, we can iterate over the collection elements by using the iterator() method.
